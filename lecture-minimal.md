# Introduction to Economics

This document provides a basic introduction to economic principles. We will explore fundamental concepts that form the foundation of economic analysis.

## Supply and Demand

Supply and demand are the cornerstone concepts in economics, forming the basis of market analysis. The supply curve illustrates producer behavior at various price points, showing how much they're willing to sell. Conversely, the demand curve represents consumer behavior and purchasing decisions.

Market equilibrium occurs at the intersection of supply and demand curves. At this point, the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded, and the market clears efficiently. This equilibrium price represents the market's natural balance.

## Economic Models

Economic models are simplified representations of economic processes. They help economists understand complex systems by focusing on the most important relationships.

Models make assumptions to simplify reality. While no model is perfect, good models provide valuable insights into how the economy works.
