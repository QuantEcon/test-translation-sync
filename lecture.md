# Introduction to Economics

This document provides a basic introduction to economic principles. We will explore fundamental concepts that form the foundation of economic analysis.

## Supply and Demand

Supply and demand are the most fundamental concepts in economics. The supply curve shows how much producers are willing to sell at different prices, while the demand curve shows how much consumers are willing to buy.

When markets are in equilibrium, the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded. This equilibrium price balances the interests of buyers and sellers.

## Economic Models

Economic models are simplified representations of economic processes. They help economists understand complex systems by focusing on the most important relationships.

Models make assumptions to simplify reality. While no model is perfect, good models provide valuable insights into how the economy works.

## Market Equilibrium

Market equilibrium represents the state where supply equals demand. At this point, there is no tendency for the price to change, as the market has reached a stable state. Understanding equilibrium is crucial for analyzing market dynamics.
