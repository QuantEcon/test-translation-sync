# Introduction to Economics

This document provides a basic introduction to economic principles. We will explore fundamental concepts that form the foundation of economic analysis.

## Supply and Demand

Supply and demand are the most fundamental concepts in economics. The supply curve shows how much producers are willing to sell at different prices, while the demand curve shows how much consumers are willing to buy.

When markets are in equilibrium, the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded. This equilibrium price balances the interests of buyers and sellers.
