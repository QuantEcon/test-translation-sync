# Introduction to Economics

This document provides a basic introduction to economic principles. We will explore fundamental concepts that form the foundation of economic analysis.

## Supply and Demand

Supply and demand are the most fundamental concepts in economics. The supply curve shows how much producers are willing to sell at different prices, while the demand curve shows how much consumers are willing to buy.

### Market Equilibrium

Market equilibrium occurs when supply equals demand. At this critical point, the quantity that producers want to sell exactly matches what consumers want to buy. This equilibrium price represents a stable state where market forces are balanced, and there is no inherent pressure for prices to change.

## Economic Models

Economic models are simplified representations of economic processes. They help economists understand complex systems by focusing on the most important relationships.

Models make assumptions to simplify reality. While no model is perfect, good models provide valuable insights into how the economy works.
